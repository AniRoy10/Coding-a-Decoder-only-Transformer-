Kolkata, formerly known as Calcutta (its official name until 2001), is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of West Bengal. It lies on the eastern bank of the Hooghly River, approximately 80 km (50 mi) west of the Bangladesh border. Kolkata is the primary financial and commercial hub of eastern and northeastern India. It is the seventh most populous city in India, with an estimated city proper population of 4.5 million (0.45 crore). Its metropolitan region, the Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA), is the third most populous metropolitan region in India, with a population exceeding 15 million (1.5 crore). Kolkata is widely regarded as the cultural capital of India and holds immense historical and cultural significance in the Bengal region.

The city originated from three villages that were once under the rule of the Nawab of Bengal during the Mughal era. In 1690, the Nawab granted the East India Company a trading license, leading to the development of Fort William in the region. In 1756, Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah occupied the fort, but he was defeated the following year at the Battle of Plassey (1757). His general, Mir Jafar, mutinied in favor of the East India Company and was later installed as the Nawab for a brief period. Under British rule, Kolkata became the de facto capital of India until 1911. It was the second-largest city in the British Empire (after London) and served as the center of bureaucracy, politics, law, education, science, and the arts in India. The city played a crucial role in the Bengali Renaissance and was a major hub of the Indian nationalist movement.

The Partition of Bengal in 1947 profoundly impacted Kolkata's economic and political landscape. Once the leading center of Indian commerce, culture, and politics, the city experienced decades of political unrest and economic decline before witnessing a resurgence. In 1971, during the Bangladesh Liberation War, Kolkata hosted the government-in-exile of Bangladesh. The city also saw a massive influx of Hindu refugees from East Bengal (present-day Bangladesh) after Partition (1947), significantly reshaping its demographics and politics. Over time, Kolkata was overtaken by Mumbai (formerly Bombay) as India's largest city in terms of population and economic prominence.
